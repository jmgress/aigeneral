## What Do People Get Wrong (and Right) About AI?

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">

<div style="width: 45%;">

#### **Misconceptions:**
- AI is sentient or “thinking”  
- It will immediately replace jobs  
- It’s always accurate and unbiased  

</div>

<div style="width: 45%;">

#### **Truths:**
- It *is* transformative  
- Boosts productivity and creativity  
- Raises real ethical and legal questions  

</div>

</div>

> *"AI is not a magic wand—it’s a tool shaped by human hands."*

<!-- _speaker: Emphasize that AI isn't magic—it’s built by humans and reflects our data, biases, and use cases. Clarify the difference between general and narrow AI, and highlight AI's ability to augment rather than replace. -->

---

## How Can Employers Address Ethical and Practical Differences in AI Adoption?

- Foster **transparency** in AI initiatives  
- Establish **clear policies** for responsible use  
- Promote **open dialogue** and diverse viewpoints  
- Invest in **AI literacy and training programs**  
- Form an **AI ethics and governance committee**  

👥 Building trust starts with leadership  

<!-- _speaker: Highlight the importance of proactive leadership in addressing employee concerns. Share examples like internal training, open forums, and governance structures to ensure ethical AI adoption. -->

### Will Government Regulate AI at Work?

<div style="display: flex; justify-content: space-between;">

<div style="width: 45%;">

#### **Current Actions:**
- **U.S. executive orders**  
- **EU AI Act**  
- **FTC AI transparency guidance**

</div>

<div style="width: 45%;">

#### **Likely Areas of Regulation:**
- Bias detection  
- Worker surveillance  
- AI explainability  
- Data privacy  

</div>

</div>

🏛️ It's essential that we strike the right balance in regulation to avoid stifling innovation. As nations around the world race toward AGI and ASI, we must ensure that leadership in these transformative technologies rests with countries that share our values and interests.

<!-- _speaker: Share that companies should prepare for regulation as a certainty—not a possibility. If they're ahead of it with internal governance, they won’t be scrambling later. -->

# 🌍 Global AI Regulation Overview

| Regulation / Guidance        | Region | Scope                     | Highlights |
|-----------------------------|--------|---------------------------|------------|
| 🇺🇸 **U.S. Executive Order (2023)** | U.S.    | Broad federal directive   | Safety, civil rights, privacy, innovation |
| 🇪🇺 **EU AI Act (2024)**            | EU     | Binding law               | Risk tiers, fines, testing, explainability |
| 🇺🇸 **FTC AI Guidance**             | U.S.    | Existing law enforcement  | Transparency, fairness, data protection |

<!-- Speaker Notes:
🧠 Key Takeaways:
- U.S. EO emphasizes **innovation and safeguards**
- EU AI Act sets **legal obligations** by risk
- FTC focuses on **truthfulness, bias, and responsibility**

This slide summarizes how major regulators are responding to AI. The U.S. Executive Order sets the tone for federal engagement, focusing on collaboration and security. The EU’s AI Act is currently the most comprehensive and enforceable law in the world. Meanwhile, the FTC is leveraging existing laws to keep AI deployments fair, transparent, and accountable.
-->

<!--
Absolutely. In fact, we’re already seeing that scenario emerge.

Governments around the world are stepping in—whether it’s the EU AI Act, which classifies AI systems by risk level and imposes strict legal requirements, or the U.S. Executive Orders, which focus on safe, secure, and trustworthy AI while laying the groundwork for more formal regulation. Even the FTC is leveraging existing laws to ensure companies are transparent, fair, and accountable in their AI use.

But here’s the reality: regulation is only part of the answer. It’s really up to us as leaders to ensure AI is used ethically and responsibly—well before any mandate tells us to.

Within the organizations I support, before you’re even allowed to use Generative AI, you must complete training on what you can and can’t do. There are guardrails in place, and continuous oversight to ensure these tools are used in ways that align with company policies and ethical standards.

And this isn’t new. Every time we adopt new technology—whether it’s email, video conferencing, or now AI—we evaluate its capabilities and define responsible use. For example:

We don’t enable Teams call transcripts by default to protect privacy.
We have strict guidelines for using AI features in tools like Microsoft Teams. You're not allowed to ask questions like “How is this person reacting to the changes?” or use AI to assess individual performance.
So yes, I do see government regulation becoming more common—and that can be a good thing. But it’s leadership, not legislation, that will set the tone for ethical AI adoption in the workplace.

That said, we must be careful not to overregulate innovation. AI is a transformative technology, and the U.S. must lead, not lag—especially when other global powers that don’t share our values are racing ahead. Responsible leadership and global competitiveness must go hand in hand.
